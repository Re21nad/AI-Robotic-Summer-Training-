Hi, Now I want to tell you about the how the robot moves in the map, so first of all I opened the gazebo which is empty https://www9.0zz0.com/2022/08/17/18/218003779.png, second, I insert the map on it which is in this pic: https://www9.0zz0.com/2022/08/17/18/419324317.png and then, we see the robot that moves in it with 2D arrow.
The additional picture which is the map of the house (just experience): https://www9.0zz0.com/2022/08/17/18/459170473.png

Thank you...
