Hi, this is the task for IOT path. 
These are the steps to turn on the ESP32 

First we need to search in google chrome and download the Arduino IDE the last version on PC, then we lunch it.
Second from the menue bar choose file then performance.
Third add the link and press OK.
Fourth choose the tools from the menue bar and then choose Board "Arduino Uno" then search the ESP32 Arduino and then choose the WEMOS D1 MINI.
Last thing connect the ESP32 board to your PC and go back to tools bar to select port then select the right port.

Thank you...
